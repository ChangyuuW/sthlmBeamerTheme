=================

The [Beamer class](http://www.tex.ac.uk/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/beamer/doc/beameruserguide.pdf) for LaTeX / XeTeX is used to create presentations, which can be shown using a projector or screen.  The typesetting system creates PDF files that can be viewed using numerous programs.
	
This theme is a demonstration of the sthlm beamer theme, which is **HEAVILY** based on the HSRM beamer theme created by [Benjamin Weiss](mailto:benjamin.weiss@student.hs-rm.de), which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/hsrmbeamertheme/hsrmbeamertheme).
